Hello! :)

I'm currently a Master’s student in Mechatronics at the University of Siegen, with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. My aim is to contribute to advancements in Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning.

At present, I’m doing an internship at Schneider Electric, where I’m working on Multi-Level Fault Classification of Images using YOLOv8 and developing a Deep Learning model to tackle this challenge. 

Since there’s always more to learn in these areas, I’m eager to engage in discussions and share insights that can enhance our understanding of these exciting domains.
